In recent years, we have seen machine learning become increasingly popular in tackling classic business challenges. Every now and then, a new algorithm is published that outperforms the existing state of the art. It is only natural for organizations (of all sizes) to strive to incorporate the remarkable capabilities of machine learning into their fundamental functions.
This chapter looks at a binary classification problem from the finance business. We use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Source, which is a popular data repository. The dataset utilised in this chapter was gathered in an October 2005 at a Taiwanese bank. The research was conducted.
Motivated by the fact that, at the time, an increasing number of banks were providing credit (either in cash or through credit cards) to willing clients. Furthermore, more people, regardless of their ability to repay, accrued huge sums of debt. As a result of all of this, some people were unable to fulfil their existing bills. In other terms, they went into default on their debts.
I will be familiar with a real-world approach to a machine learning challenge, from data collection and cleaning through the construction and optimization of a classifier. Another important takeaway is comprehending the overall approach to machine learning projects, which can subsequently be applied to a variety of jobs. Whether it's predicting churn or evaluating the cost of new real estate in an area.
